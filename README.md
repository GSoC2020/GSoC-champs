# GSoC-champs
This year we are going to handle about 100 students. We are a team of past year Google Summer of Code students and some are present year GSoC mentors too. We help the students to get into the program by guiding them at each step. For premium students we even draft their proposals.

### Since, it's the peak time , ensure your success by enrolling with us. 
We are there to provide full help and guidance based upon your skills.
Interested students can have access to this opportunity by contacting our admins:- Xeoung Liu (xeoung.liu.2003@gmail.com) and Akshay Yadav (aks675ydv@gmail.com)
